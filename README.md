Toony Cam is a live photo editing app where children can generate a cartoony selfie using a face filter overlay. 
Toony Cam provides cartoony experiences that let children overcome visual limits and develop skills through the use of technology and imagery.

The Toonycam app allows its users to take a selfie image with a cartoon face filter applied automatically without any user interaction or manually applied as well, create their own cartoon themed masks, share them through the most popular social media networks and/or directly to friends, and save it to the cloud and/or locally to their device. Toonycam provides a vast library of graphics items such as ears, noses, eyes and mouths for creating custom themes. Combination of these items are limitless, and the process to create a filter helps children to use their creativity and enhance their logical skills, by their own or collaboratively with friends, in real-time...
